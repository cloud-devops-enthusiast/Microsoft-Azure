**Azure Policies**

Azure policy is a service by Microsoft Azure which allows you to Create, Assign and Manage Polices to control or audit of your resources in Azure. These policies make the resources in Azure to be compliant with the rules and regulations with the corporate standards and service level agreements. You can enforce these policies using the management groups.

**Management Groups**

Management groups are the containers which provide a wider scope for the policies above the subscriptions. Here you organize the subscriptions in the management groups, where you apply the governance conditions and policies are inherited to the subsriptions in the management groups. Management groups gives you the enterprise level management at the scale without the need to manage the individual subscriptions. All the subscriptions under the management groups must trust the Azure Active Directory tenant where the management group is created.
